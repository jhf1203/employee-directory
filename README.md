### Description
      
This is an app that gives the user a simple view of their team's basic information that's able to be easily manipulated and filtered.  It is written in React to be optimized for larger organizations, and allows the user to quickly filter and sort across multiple fields to narrow the list to only show information that they would like to see

### Usage

#### Demonstration (gif):

![image](./public/demo.gif)
  
Upon loading the page you will see a list of all employees in an organization, including several key components regarding their employment:  

- First Name
- Last Name
- E-mail Address
- Department
- Hire Date
- Gender

Above each column you'll see options to both filter and sort.  To filter simply enter text down to which you would like to narrow results into the corresponding input.  To sort simply click the arrows in each column in the "sort" row (ascending or descending).  The filtered and sorted information automatically renders, so there is no additional action needed from the user.
